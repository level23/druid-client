 * Class FilteredAggregator
 *
 * A filtered aggregator wraps any given aggregator,
 * but only aggregates the values for which the given dimension filter matches.
 *
 * This makes it possible to compute the results of a filtered and an unfiltered
 * aggregation simultaneously, without having to issue multiple queries,
 * and use both results as part of post-aggregations.
 *
 * Note: If only the filtered results are required,
 * consider putting the filter on the query itself, which will be much faster since
 * it does not require scanning all the data.
