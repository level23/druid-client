     * CardinalityAggregator constructor.
     *
     * Computes the cardinality of a set of Apache Druid (incubating) dimensions, using HyperLogLog to estimate the
     * cardinality. Please note that this aggregator will be much slower than indexing a column with the hyperUnique
     * aggregator. This aggregator also runs over a dimension column, which means the string dimension cannot be
     * removed from the dataset to improve rollup. In general, we strongly recommend using the hyperUnique aggregator
     * instead of the cardinality aggregator if you do not care about the individual values of a dimension.
     *
     * The HyperLogLog algorithm generates decimal estimates with some error. "round" can be set to true to round off
     * estimated values to whole numbers. Note that even with rounding, the cardinality is still an estimate. The
     * "round" field only affects query-time behavior, and is ignored at ingestion-time.
     *
     * When setting byRow to false (the default) it computes the cardinality of the set composed of the union of all
     * dimension values for all the given dimensions. For a single dimension, this is equivalent to:
     * ```
     * SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(dimension)) FROM <datasource>
     * ```
     *
     * For multiple dimensions, this is equivalent to something akin to
     * ```
     * SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(value)) FROM (
     * SELECT dim_1 as value FROM <datasource>
     * UNION
     * SELECT dim_2 as value FROM <datasource>
     * UNION
     * SELECT dim_3 as value FROM <datasource>
     * )
     * ```
     *
     * When setting byRow to true it computes the cardinality by row, i.e. the cardinality of distinct dimension
     * combinations. This is equivalent to something akin to
     *
     * ```
     * SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ( SELECT DIM1, DIM2, DIM3 FROM <datasource> GROUP BY DIM1, DIM2, DIM3 )
     * ```
