/**
 * GroupBy queries can be executed using two different strategies. The default strategy for a cluster is determined
 * by the "druid.query.groupBy.defaultStrategy" runtime property on the Broker. This can be overridden using
 * "groupByStrategy" in the query context. If neither the context field nor the property is set, the "v2" strategy
 * will be used.
 *
 *
 * "v2", the default, is designed to offer better performance and memory management. This strategy generates
 * per-segment results using a fully off-heap map. Data processes merge the per-segment results using a fully
 * off-heap concurrent facts map combined with an on-heap string dictionary. This may optionally involve spilling
 * to disk. Data processes return sorted results to the Broker, which merges result streams using an N-way merge.
 * The broker materializes the results if necessary (e.g. if the query sorts on columns other than its dimensions).
 * Otherwise, it streams results back as they are merged.
 *
 * "v1", a legacy engine, generates per-segment results on data processes (Historical, realtime, MiddleManager)
 * using a map which is partially on-heap (dimension keys and the map itself) and partially off-heap (the
 * aggregated values). Data processes then merge the per-segment results using Druid's indexing mechanism. This
 * merging is multi-threaded by default, but can optionally be single-threaded. The Broker merges the final result
 * set using Druid's indexing mechanism again. The broker merging is always single-threaded. Because the Broker
 * merges results using the indexing mechanism, it must materialize the full result set before returning any
 * results. On both the data processes and the Broker, the merging index is fully on-heap by default, but it can
 * optionally store aggregated values off-heap.
 *
 * Overrides the value of druid.query.groupBy.defaultStrategy for this query.
